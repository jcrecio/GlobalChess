# GlobalChess
Global Chess is a REST API to play chess.

The API consist of some REST methods in order to provide functionality for several games.
## 1. Requirements   
Having python installed in the system.   
Having mongo installed in the system.   
Install python-chess library. This is the chess library core the api uses underneath.   
Install Flask for supporting REST implementation.    
Install PyMongo to handle mongo via python.   
   
> Pending Dockerize to automate all the steps for the installation, build and deployment   
   
## 2. Run the server
The mongo server needs to be started off with the provide configuration file.      
```python
  mongod -f <path>/gamesdb.conf
````

You need to execute the python file indicating the path of the engine to be used in the api.
```python
  restapi.py rybka.exe
````

## 3. Start playing
In order to start a new game you have 2 options, ask for the CPU move or do your own move.
All the moves follow the UCI chess format.

[UCI Protocol Specification](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html)  

### 3.0 Create new game
```javascript
POST /games/new      
HEADERS:      
  user: <user>
```
This operation creates a new game.

```json
HTTP RESPONSE: 201
{
  "GameId":  "GUID"
}
```

### 3.1 CPU move
```javascript
POST /game/<__game id__>/board/moves/best    
```
It will apply and return the best CPU move for the game specified, no matter the turn.
There is no required information to be sent via POST, the CPU will change the state of the game directly with the best move it finds.  
  
The output of the method is as follows:
```json
HTTP RESPONSE: 201
{
  "Move": "CPU UCI form move, eg: c2c3"
}
```
 
### 3.2 Player move
```javascript
POST /game/<__game id__>/board/move    
```
It will apply the move done by the user. If the game does not exist yet, it will create a new one with the first move done by the user.  
The body request looks like:
```json
{ 
  "move": "a2a3" 
}
```
The output of the method is identical if the operation went well:
```json
HTTP RESPONSE: 201
{
  "Move": "a2a3"
}
```

### 3.3 Undo move
```javascript
POST /game/<__game id__>/board/undo    
```
It will undo the last move on the game. The moves' stack only includes the moves played during a session.
If you stopped playing a game and restarted lestÂ´s day, next day, the stack will be empty.

The output of the method contains the current position after having applied the undo.
```json
HTTP RESPONSE: 201
{
  "PreviousPosition": "8/p1pk1ppp/4p3/N2rPb2/2p5/b1P1B3/P4PPP/4r1K1 w - - 0 24"
}
```

### 3.4 Delete game
In order to remove an existing game.      
```javascript
DELETE /game/<__game id__>/delete    
```            
```
HTTP RESPONSE: 204
No content
```
## 4. Display data
